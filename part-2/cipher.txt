"I love cryptography!"

I will use a reflector to generate the first cipher key.

If I can I will then double cipher that with a caeser cipher by +2.

Cipher 1:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz = zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
Cipher 2:
zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba= 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25
